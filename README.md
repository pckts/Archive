# Archive
As time passes unmaintained scripts become broken, inefficient, or most commonly, irrelevant.

Anything found within this Archive repo, will be completely unmaintained, likely to be broken, or genereally be scraps and pieces stitched together in a more or less incoherent manner
The archives sole purpose is to provide a scrapyard of code that can be recycled into new scripts, and you should not use any tools found in here
